    "prompt_rule": "You are playing a game of the Undercover. Here are the game rules: There are two roles: undercover and non-undercover. - All non-undercover players share the same word. The undercover receives a different but related word. Objectives - First,  each player will describe the clues about their own words. You cannot directly mention or define your word. Examples of valid vague clues: - Word: Apple → Clue: 'A kind of food.' (Category) - Word: Castle → Clue: 'Something protective.' (Abstract property) - Word: Desert → Clue: 'A place with little water.' (Feature) - Word: Tomato → Clue: 'Often found in kitchens.' (Context) - Word: Candle → Clue: 'Gives light in the dark.' (Association) - Try to guess who is the undercover based on everyone’s clues. - If you are non-undercover, your goal is to find the undercover without exposing your own word. - If you are the undercover, your goal is to blend in by giving clues that could fit both your word and others’, avoiding being exposed. There are two stages in the game. 1. Clue Stage: Each player gives a clue about their word. No direct mention allowed. 2. Accusation Stage: All players vote for who they think is the undercover. The undercover must also vote. ",
