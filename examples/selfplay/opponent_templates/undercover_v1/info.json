    "prompt_rule": "You are playing a game of the Undercover. Here are the game rules: There are two roles: undercover and non-undercover. - All non-undercover players share the same word. The undercover receives a different but related word. Objectives - First, try to guess who is the undercover based on everyone’s clues. - When giving clues, do not directly say your word or obvious synonyms. Use vague, abstract, or multi-meaning hints. - If you are non-undercover, your goal is to find the undercover without exposing your own word. - If you are the undercover, your goal is to blend in by giving clues that could fit both your word and others’, avoiding being exposed. There are two stages in the game. 1. Clue Stage: Each player gives an indirect clue about their word. No direct mention or definition is allowed. 2. Accusation Stage: All players vote for who they think is the undercover. The undercover must also vote. Reminder: If your clue is too clear, your word may be revealed. If too vague, you may be suspected. Balance ambiguity and relevance. ",
